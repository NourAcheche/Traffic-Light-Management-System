# Traffic-Light-Management-System
This project implements a Traffic Light Management System using the PIC16F887A microcontroller to control vehicle and pedestrian traffic. It manages a normal road and a right-side road using a PIR motion sensor to detect movement and give priority when needed. A pedestrian button allows safe crossing
My circuit have 2 PIC16F877A (one for the sensors and seven segment and one for traffic light ,button , pedestrian lifht , sensor HCRS04 and LCD I2C)

- the proteus diagram includes the two sensors of the car 
- there also the hex file and c file fro the sensor
- the traff file that include hex and c file have the rafiic light part about the car traffic and the pedestrian traffic with button 
- we have some photos that demonstrate how it looks in a prototype
